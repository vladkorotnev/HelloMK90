A hello world skeleton for the Elektronika MK-90.

Currently can only be inserted into the SMP 0 slot as I didn't yet figure out how to determine the SMP slot number we are currently in.

Why?
	The MK90 only loads first 512 (o1000) bytes from the SMP at address 0000 in RAM, sets SP to o1000, and runs from 0000. 512 bytes is a challenging amount of data, but isn't really enough to do anything, so this shows how to load extra code from the SMP afterwards.

Requires: 
	MACRO-11 (https://github.com/shattered/macro11)
	obj2bin	 (https://github.com/AK6DN/obj2bin)

Includes:
	hello90.mac — the program itself
	Makefile	— self-explanatory
	test.png	- a 1-bit 120x64 splash screen for the program
	gazou2mk.py	- converts a 1-bit 120x64 image into an MK90 screen dump (adding the .mk90 extension)
	file2oct.py	- transcodes a binaryfile into a list of .byte directives in octal system (.radix 8)
