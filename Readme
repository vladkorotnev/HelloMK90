A hello world skeleton for the Elektronika MK-90.
Currently can only be inserted into the SMP 0 slot as I didn't yet figure out how to determine the SMP slot number we are currently in.

Requires: 
	MACRO-11 (https://github.com/shattered/macro11)
	obj2bin	 (https://github.com/AK6DN/obj2bin)

Includes:
	hello90.mac — the program itself
	Makefile	— self-explanatory
	test.png	- a 1-bit 120x64 splash screen for the program
	gazou2mk.py	- converts a 1-bit 120x64 image into an MK90 screen dump (adding the .mk90 extension)
	file2oct.py	- transcodes a binaryfile into a list of .byte directives in octal system (.radix 8)
